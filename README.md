# Time-Series-Forecasting

Data Science Professional Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a data science professional project. The project aims to forecast the stock market price of Apple for the next 30 days. Various data science techniques and libraries are used to analyze historical stock data and build a predictive model.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis and forecasting.
notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
scripts/: This directory contains Python scripts that can be used for specific tasks or automation.
models/: This directory stores trained models or serialized objects used for prediction.
reports/: This directory contains reports, visualizations, and documentation related to the project.
requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python libraries and their versions for reproducing the project environment.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
Setup and Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the instructions within the notebooks to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, build the forecasting model, and evaluate its performance.
Modify the code or experiment with different models and techniques as needed.
Use the scripts in the scripts/ directory for specific tasks or automation.
Store trained models or serialized objects in the models/ directory for future use.
Generate reports, visualizations, or documentation in the reports/ directory.
